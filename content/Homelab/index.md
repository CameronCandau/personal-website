I maintain a homelab to gain experience with new technologies while reclaiming digital agency in my life.

### [v2](/homelab-v2/)
Infrastructure-as-Code implementation of the foundation established in v1, followed by scaling to more services. In active development.

### [v1](/homelab-v1/)
My first homelab iteration - Dell Optiplex running Proxmox with Immich, Jellyfin, and basic infrastructure. Manual provisioning and configuration of 3 services and a reverse proxy. Incremental backups to cloud.
