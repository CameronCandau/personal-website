I maintain a homelab to gain experience with new technologies while reclaiming digital agency in my life.

## Series

### [v1](/homelab-v1/homelab-v1/)
My first homelab iteration - Dell Optiplex running Proxmox with Immich, Jellyfin, and basic infrastructure. Manual provisioning and configuration of 3 services and a reverse proxy. Incremental backups to cloud.

### v2
**Details coming soon.**

Infrastructure-as-Code implementation of the foundation established in v1, followed by scaling to more services.
