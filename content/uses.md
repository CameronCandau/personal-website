These are the things I use! I value privacy, freedom, data ownership, and digital minimalism, so I tend to research product features and policies thoroughly before making a purchase.

If I list something here, it means I generally appreciate it's presence in my life, and would recommend it to others, though I have no affiliation, and none of these are affiliate marketing links.
