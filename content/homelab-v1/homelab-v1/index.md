# Summary
This iteration was functional, but pretty basic. Although I used it for a few months from August to December, I was manually creating and configuring my infrastructure and applications. 

# Inspiration for next time
- Document network architecture and IPAM better from the start
- Dashboard / uptime monitoring
- Redo public documentation style -- rather than a walkthrough, just showcase architecture and how things are. Walkthroughs and devlogs, etc, can be saved for a separate blog post.
- Implement proper internal DNS (Pihole or BIND9)
- Leverage more Infrastructure as Code! 
	- Nix/NixOS
	- Terraform
	- Ansible
- Automate with n8n
- Figure out how to make Kubernetes make sense for the homelab
- Run a mail server
- Run an Anki Sync server
